Final Project for JavaScript MDIA 2132

This is my Final Project for my Javascript MDIA-2132 class.

-To Play-

- Begin the game by using your keyboard to guess a letter in the hidden word.
- If your guess is incorrect, the letter guessed will be presented in the "Incorrect Guesses" box.
- If your guess is correct, the correct letter in the word will present itself
- If you guess a letter that has already been guessed, the letter will be ignored and not presented a second time in the "Incorrect Guesses" box.
- The player is allowed no more than 6 incorrect guessed letters.
- If the player exceeds 6 incorrect guesses, the game is over and a pop-up will tell you.
- The player will then be presented with an option to "Reset". On click, the page will be reset.
- If the player guesses the hidden word, WOOHOO!, you have won!
- The player will then be shown a pop-up displaying they have won and will be able to "Play Again"

  Enjoy my first Javascript Game!!
